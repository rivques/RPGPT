# How to run your own NPC
Hi! This will teach you how to set up your own LLM-based Bag bot. We'll host it on Nest, Hack Club's program for free compute for teens, and run it on Hack Club's free OpenAI proxy.
## Prerequisites
* A [Nest]() account. Follow the [Quickstart](https://guides.hackclub.app/index.php/Quickstart) to get an account if you don't have one already.
* An editor. I reccoment VS Code with the Remote SSH extension, but you could use something like `nano` or `vim` if you're more hardcore than me.
## Sign into your Nest account
Open 
## Fork and clone this repository
Log into your Nest account. Then, run the following command, replacing YOURNAME with your 
GitHub username and REPONAME with the name of the repository you just
created: `git clone https://github.com/YOURNAME/REPONAME`.
